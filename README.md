# Identification of sustainability-focused campaigns on thekickstarter crowdfunding platform

This project, in particular, focuses on crowdfunded campaigns in the kickstarter platform and explores a dataset of c.a 184,186 initiatives from different domains (e.g, Technology, Music, Publishing etc.). The
goal of the analyses here is to find the most important features that are relevant to initiatives that are
both sustainable as well as profitable. The analyses will also explore the possible relationship of the
features with each other, and elucidate insights that might contribute to better understanding of the
success/failure propsects of current and future environment focused crowdfunded initiatives.
